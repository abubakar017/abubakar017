👋 Hi, I'm Abubakar

👀 I'm an aspiring full-stack data scientist with a passion for machine learning, natural language processing, data analysis, and dashboarding. I'm currently learning and exploring new ways to use these technologies to solve real-world problems and gain insights from data.

🌱 I’m currently learning about ML and NLP fundamentals, as well as data engineering, data analysis, and machine learning modeling. I'm also interested in learning more about how to apply ML, NLP, and data analysis to social impact problems.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ML/data science projects under the guidance of experienced mentors. I'm also interested in contributing to open source ML/data science projects and making dashboards to visualize and communicate insights from data.

Here are some of my skills and interests:

**Programming languages**: Python, R
**Machine learning libraries**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch

**Natural language processing libraries**: spaCy, NLTK

**Data visualization tools**: Tableau,Powerbi,Excel Matplotlib, Dash

**Open source software development**
If you're looking for a dedicated and enthusiastic learner who is eager to contribute to ML/data science projects, data analysis, and dashboarding, please reach out to me!
